    <p>Abstract:</p>
    <p>The evolutionary success of multicellular organisms is based on the division of labor between cells. While some of 
      the molecular determinants for cell fate specification have been identified, a fundamental understanding of which 
      genetic activities are required in each cell of a developing tissue is still outstanding. The DECODE project will 
      develop and apply leading-edge system genetics methods  major model systems from the plant and animal kingdoms to 
      decode context-dependent genetic networks in vivo. To achieve this, DECODE will bring together experimental and 
      theoretical groups with complementary expertise in model organism genetics and cellular phenotyping, single-cell 
      genomics, statistics and computational biology. Building on our combined expertise, we will create functional genetic 
      maps using conditional CRISPR/Cas9-based single- and higher order knockout perturbations in vivo combined with 
      single-cell expression profiling and imaging. Coupled with powerful computational analysis, this project will not 
      only define, predict and rigorously test the unique genetic repertoire of each cell, but also unravel how genetic 
      networks adapt their topology and function across cell types and external stimuli. Consequently, we expect that 
      the DECODE project in model organisms will lay the conceptual and methodological foundation for perturbation-based 
      functional atlases in other tissues or species.
